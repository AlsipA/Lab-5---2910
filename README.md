# Here is the link to the api I am using for this project: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

# One of the few issues I ran into with this project was actually printing the picture as I have never done that before but with a couple of google searchs that was not diffcult to figure out. 

# I am having some issues with images not printing out and a correct breed entry automatically producing an error message... will update when I have it figured out. 

#turns out my api url that i entered was incorrect. I fixed that issue. The new issue is that it is printing out the image urls and not the actual image. Not sure how to fix this, I am attempting to meet with will tomorrow to ask about it.
